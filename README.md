Game Help:
- The game objective is to, using the resources of the user, to generate a specific structure of cells on the board. This structure of cells
is only possible by using the sub-rules, which allow you to generate more cells on the board that may be needed to generate that final structure.
Generations can be done by pressing the button on the left, and tiles can be switched either by 0-10 on the keyboard or by clicking on them directly.

A rule can only be matched if every flat edge of the set touches an empty space.
